# CSharpCourse
## 👋 Welcome to My C# Sandbox

Hey there! This repo is where I’ve been leveling up my C# and .NET skills through projects, experiments, and plenty of trial and error.

### 🛠 What’s Inside?

- Basic and advanced C# syntax practice
- Real-world object-oriented code
- ASP.NET MVC web apps (like the car insurance quote project)
- Database integration with Entity Framework and SQL Server

### 🌟 Why I Made This

I wanted to go beyond just reading about C#. So I built stuff — from console apps to full-stack web projects — to really *understand* the language and its capabilities.

### 🔍 Projects Worth Looking At

- **Insurance Quote App** – My intro to MVC, forms, models, and SQL.
- **OOP Exercises** – Exploring encapsulation, interfaces, and polymorphism.

### 🧭 Next Goals

- Build REST APIs with ASP.NET Core
- Try Blazor and desktop apps
- Dive into cloud deployment with Azure

Explore the repo, break the code, learn something new!
